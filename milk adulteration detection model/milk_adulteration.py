Please note that this model has  been specifically trained to detect the presence of five different types of adulterants in milk - bicarbonates, starch, sucrose, formaldehyde 
and peroxide. It relies on all 518 spectroscopic measurements across different wavelengths (SPC 1002 - SPC 2997) to give the most accurate 
prediction.
